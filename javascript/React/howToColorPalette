Start with greyscale. By drafting your designs in greyscale first, you’re ensuring a focus on usability and clear navigation more than getting the color of that CTA button just right. Force yourself to focus on laying out elements and optimizing white space. A clean hierarchy of type and elements will go a long wayTwitter Logo towards generating the best user experience.

Use the 60-30-10 rule. Use your colors in a 60% + 30% + 10% proportion. This old interior design rule is meant to give balance to your colors. The formula works because it allows the eye to move comfortably from one focal point to the next. It’s also incredibly simple to use: 60% is your dominant hue, 30% is your secondary color, and 10% is for an accent color. Even if your palette has more than three colors (but please, no more than five), keeping things in balance will be cleaner to the eye and more comfortable for your users’ brains.

The best color combinations come from nature. They will always look natural. The best thing about looking to the environment for design solutions is that the palette is always changing. Sunrises, sunsets, beach scenes… these all have unique palettes that can be adapted to suit your needs. Use an app like Adobe Capture (more about it in the next section) to isolate a color palette from a photo for use in other applications.
